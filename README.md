# 3D-Reconstruction-using-Homography-Constraints-for-Uncalibrated-Images
This repo contains an implementation of 3D reconstruction and Plane detection using plane-to-plane homography constraints for uncalibrated image pair under Manhattan World Assumption. Given 2 images of the same scene from different perspective which has three main orthogonal planes in space, the planes can be reconstructed up to scale. **Notice here we don't require any calibration parameters, everything is computed from 2 raw images from scratch!**
